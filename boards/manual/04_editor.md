## The editor

`EDITOR.html` on this drive is a text editor for `effects.txt` that understands
its format. Each word is coloured by its role, and as you type it suggests what
fits: __ENTRY_TARGETS__ at the start of a line, the effects after the colon,
then that effect's settings and their values. A hint below the text describes
the value expected. Tab or Enter accepts a suggestion, Escape dismisses it, and
Ctrl+Space shows suggestions again.

It underlines names it does not recognise, such as a misspelt effect or a setting
the effect does not take. Values are not checked, as the board reads them itself.
**Save to board** writes the file and **Check board** reads `errors.txt`, as in
the picker.

It suggests only what this board's firmware provides, so new firmware features
appear without the page changing. It saves in one click from a Chromium browser,
as the picker does, and from Safari or Firefox as a download you then copy onto
this drive. It needs `catalogue.js`, which sits beside it on this drive.
