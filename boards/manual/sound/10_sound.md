## Sound

The board plays a WAV file through __SOUND_THROUGH__, alongside
everything else:

```entry
audio: wav file=chimes.wav
audio: wav file=ambience.wav loop=yes
```

| Plays | Settings |
| --- | --- |
| `wav` | `file` `loop=no` |

The file plays once each time the effects start, or repeatedly with `loop`.

The board looks for the file in this drive's `sounds` folder, where the picker
adds sounds, then at the top of the drive, then on the board itself. It
opens the file before this drive is shown, so the sound keeps playing when the
drive appears on a computer. While the computer copies files to this drive, the
sound pauses with the effects, and replacing a file while it plays silences it
until the next reload.

Use an uncompressed WAV file, mono or stereo. MP3 is not supported. This drive
holds __DRIVE_SIZE__, so a lower sample rate fits more. A minute of 16-bit mono
takes about 2.6MB at 22kHz and under 1MB at 8kHz.

The board plays one sound at a time, so each scene takes one `audio` entry, and
one more can go before the first heading. An `audio` entry in a scene plays
while that scene plays, and one before the first heading plays in any scene
without its own sound. A sound paused by a scene change resumes where it left
off when its scene returns, and one that had finished starts again from the
beginning. A scene with `restart` starts its sound from the beginning every
time, along with everything else in it.
