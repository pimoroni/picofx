## Getting Started

To start coding your Tiny FX, you will need to add the following lines to the start of your code file.

```python
from tiny_fx import TinyFX
tiny = TinyFX()
```

This will create a `TinyFX` class called `tiny` that will be used in the rest of the examples going forward.


## Reading the User Button

Tiny FX has one user button, labelled **Boot**. This can be read using the `boot_pressed()` function:

```python
state_boot = tiny.boot_pressed()
```


## Setting the Mono LED Outputs

Tiny FX has six outputs for controlling chains of mono LEDs, labelled **1**, **2**, **3**, **4**, **5**, and **6**. These can be accessed either through the `outputs` list, or by individual properties, which return `PWMLED` objects:

```python
one = tiny.outputs[0]
also_one = tiny.one
```

These `PWMLED` objects offer several functions to control their associated outputs. They can be turned `on()`, turned `off()`, inverted via `toggle()` and have their brightness directly set via `brightness()`, which accepts a value from `0.0` to `1.0`.

```python
# Turn the first output on
tiny.one.on()
time.sleep(1)

# Turn the first output off
tiny.one.off()
time.sleep(1)

# Invert the first output (from off to on)
tiny.one.toggle()
time.sleep(1)

# Set the output to half brightness
tiny.one.brightness(0.5)
time.sleep(1)
```

## Setting the RGB LED Output

Tiny FX has a single RGB output for controlling chains of RGB LEDs, labelled **RGB**. This can be accessed through the `rgb` variable, which returns a `RGBLED` object:

```python
rgb = tiny.rgb
```

This `RGBLED` object offers two functions to control its associated output, `set_rgb()` which accepts `r`, `g`, and `b` values from `0` to `255`, and `set_hsv()` which accepts `h`, `s`, and `v` values from `0.0` to `1.0`.

```python
# Turn the rgb output to red
tiny.rgb.set_rgb(255, 0, 0)
# tiny.rgb.set_hsv(0, 1, 1)
time.sleep(1)

# Turn the rgb output to green
tiny.rgb.set_rgb(0, 255, 0)
# tiny.rgb.set_hsv(0.333, 1, 1)
time.sleep(1)

# Turn the rgb output to blue
tiny.rgb.set_rgb(0, 0, 255)
# tiny.rgb.set_hsv(0.666, 1, 1)
time.sleep(1)

# Turn the rgb output to white
tiny.rgb.set_rgb(255, 255, 255)
# tiny.rgb.set_hsv(0, 0, 1)
time.sleep(1)
```

It is also possible to control the individual outputs of the RGB connection by accessing the `led_r`, `led_g`, `led_b` variables on the `RGBLED`, giving access to the internal `PWMLED` objects used.

```python
# Turn the rgb output to red
tiny.rgb.led_r.on()
tiny.rgb.led_g.off()
tiny.rgb.led_b.off()
time.sleep(1)

# Turn the rgb output to green
tiny.rgb.led_r.off()
tiny.rgb.led_g.on()
tiny.rgb.led_b.off()
time.sleep(1)

# Turn the rgb output to blue
tiny.rgb.led_r.off()
tiny.rgb.led_g.off()
tiny.rgb.led_b.on()
time.sleep(1)

# Turn the rgb output to white
tiny.rgb.led_r.on()
tiny.rgb.led_g.on()
tiny.rgb.led_b.on()
time.sleep(1)
```

This can be useful for if you wish to connect up additional mono LEDs (the RGB connector can actually accept a Mono connector without any rewiring), though note that the gamma value for the RGB output is slightly different to that of the mono outputs.


## Reading Voltage

Tiny FX features onboard voltage monitoring, letting you change your effects as your battery voltage changes, perhaps to indicate when new batteries are needed. This can be read by calling `read_voltage()`, which optionally accepts a `samples` parameter to reduce noise by taking the average across multiple readings.

```python
SAMPLES = 50        # The number of measurements to take per reading, to reduce noise

voltage = tiny.read_voltage(SAMPLES)
print("Voltage =", round(voltage, 2))
```

## Effects System

To make it easier to run multiple effects simultaneously, the `PicoFX` library was created. This library hands LED control over to two classes, a `MonoPlayer` and a `ColourPlayer`, which each get assigned a range of effects objects. For more information about this, refer to the [PicoFX Library Reference](https://github.com/pimoroni/picofx/blob/main/picofx/README.md).


### Program Lifecycle

When writing a program for Tiny FX using PicoFX, there are a number of steps that should be included to make best use of the board's capabilities.


```python
# Perform system level imports here
# e.g. import math

from tiny_fx import TinyFX
from picofx import MonoPlayer       # This import is only needed if using the mono outputs
from picofx import ColourPlayer     # This import is only needed if using the colour output

# Import any effects you are using
# e.g. from picofx.mono import BinaryCounterFX
# e.g. from picofx.colour import RainbowFX

"""
This is a boilerplate example for Tiny FX. Use it as a base for your own programs.

Press "Boot" to exit the program.

# Constants
# e.g. SLEEP_TIME = 0.1

# Variables
tiny = TinyFX()     # Create a new TinyFX object. These optional keyword parameters are supported:
                    # `init_i2c`, `init_wav`, and `wav_root`
player = MonoPlayer(tiny.outputs)       # Create a new effect player to control TinyFX's mono outputs
rgb_player = ColourPlayer(tiny.rgb)     # Create a new effect player to control TinyFX's rgb output

# Create your effects objects here
# e.g. binary = BinaryCounterFX(interval=0.1)

# Set up the mono effects to play
# e.g. player.effects = [
#          binary(0),
#          binary(1),
#          binary(2),
#          binary(3),
#          binary(4),
#          binary(5)
#      ]

# Set up the colour effect to play
# e.g. rgb_player.effects = RainbowFX(speed=0.2, sat=1.0, val=1.0)

# Have the RGB player run in sync with the Mono player
player.pair(rgb_player)


# Place other variables here
# e.g. button_state = False


# Put any functions needed for your program here
# e.g. def my_function():
#          pass


# Wrap the code in a try block, to catch any exceptions (including KeyboardInterrupt)
try:
    player.start()   # Start the effects running

    # Perform any other setup

    # Loop until the effect stops or the "Boot" button is pressed
    while player.is_running() and not tiny.boot_pressed():
        #######################
        # Put your program here
        #######################
        pass

# Stop any running effects and turn off all the outputs
finally:
    player.stop()
    tiny.shutdown()
```
